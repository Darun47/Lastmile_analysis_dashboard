# 🚛 Last-Mile Delivery Optimization Dashboard  
### FA-2 Project — Maths for AI – II  
---

## 📌 Overview  
This project is basically a Streamlit dashboard that is made to easily check how fast deliveries happen in the last step of the delivery process. The dashboard helps to understand what things are affecting the delivery time — like traffic, weather, distance, which vehicle is used, and which area the delivery is going to.
It shows everything in a clean and understandable way so we can see what’s causing delays and how it can be improved.

The purpose is to provide a **data-driven solution** for improving last-mile logistics efficiency in real time.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze delivery time performance across different conditions  
- Provide a clear, visual dashboard for delivery insights  
- Enable filtering based on real-world logistics variables  
- Identify problem patterns (e.g., delays due to distance, traffic, weather)  
- Present actionable recommendations based on data analytics

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard

### 🔹 1. Sidebar Filters  
The user can filter deliveries by:
- Delivery Distance  
- Traffic Level  
- Weather Condition  
- Vehicle Type  
- Delivery Zone  
- Package Category  
- Agent Rating & Age  

### 🔹 2. KPI Metrics  
The dashboard shows:
- Average Delivery Time
- Delay Percentage
- Fastest Delivery Vehicle 
- **Worst-Performing Area**  

These update automatically with filters.

### 🔹 3. Visual Analytics  
Includes:
- Delay Analyzer (Weather × Traffic heatmap)  
- Vehicle Performance Chart  
- Area-wise Delivery Time Bar Chart  
- Category Performance Chart  
- Agent Rating vs Delivery Time Scatter Plot
